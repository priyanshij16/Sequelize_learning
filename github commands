Q what is vcs?
ans- version control system helps to keep manage and track files ex : git, Apache , piper(google)

 >>Git init:  git will track specified folder , also create hidden folder which is named as .git 
>> ls -a :     by entering this command you will get to see this folder 
 (U) git untracked 
   ------------

>> git add "file name" :     this will add file from untracked to added (stagging area)
>> git log :              it will enable to see all the commits done before in bottom -up manner . 
                        type q/z  : for exit
>> git log (oneline)   :  this command will displays the "short sha" and "short description".

>> git diff  :             after doing any modification it will show all list of changes 
>> git show:  "sha_id":  visualise what all are the changes done before 
>> git blame  :          it will show line by line code and will tell this line is written by this author on date... 
>> git status :            On branch master
                         nothing to commit, working tree clean
>> git add .    :        it will add all the files to the stagging area 
>> git reset hard--  : technique to revert back it will change the ( Head ptr to another commit )
>> git revert " "    : it will create new commit and 
                            NOTE/HEALTHY TIP:
 developers shouldn't do all folders in one commit instead of it make isolated functions then commit each of them

                                         Normal Gyan :
public server : its a central server where you can push commits or pull commits    ex github , bitbucket and gitLab 
      why to use ? so that code maintain rhe and cloud pr save rhe 

  
1 git request --> A pull request is a way to ask another developer to merge one of your branches into their repository. 
This not only makes it easier for project leads to keep track of changes, but also lets developers initiate
discussions around their work before integrating it with the rest of the codebas
